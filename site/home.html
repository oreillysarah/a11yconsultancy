            <h2> Sarah O'Reilly - Consultant, Msc Computing (Assistive Technology) </h2>
            
            <p class="maintext">Originally an occupational therapist with 4 years experience working directly with people with disabilities 
            , specializing in Assistive technology and Web Accessibility.
                 I completed a masters in Assistive technology gaining 11 first class honours in the 11 subjects presented.
                  I also wrote a dissertation on web accessibility, please see https://arrow.dit.ie/scschcomdis/50/.<p>

                      <br>
I have nearly 7 yearsâ€™ experience working in web accessibility with large multinationals including IBM and UHG/ Optum. I worked 
 as a consultant in web accessibility with customers. I was also the accessibility focal point for an entire product in IBM (IBM Connections). 
 <br>
 My work included Accessibility audits of websites according
to WCAG2.0/WCAG 2.1/ Section 508 and working directly with developers, scrum masters, QA, program managers to make websites AA compliant.
   <br>

   <br>
    Other tasks as a consultant included preparing technical accessibility content for internal accessibility website
     based on WCAG 2.0 (e.g. headers, link purpose) and researching WCAG 2.0 and WCAG 2.1 guidelines. Examples include colour contrast
      and gradients and dropdown menus. Other tasks include presentation of best accessibility practices to team. E.g. aria techniques, 
      showcase of more challenging a11y areas such as form errors and writing accessibility content for internal newsletter. I use a 
      combination of screen readers such as JAWS and NDVA. Automated testing tools such as Wave, firebug, colour contrast analyser,
       Axe and the VOIP dragon naturally speaking.
<br>

<p> While working for IBM I also published 
 an article (nearly achieving patent status) A System and Method for automatically reporting and motivating fixes for accessibility issues - IP.com. 
  I am currently Studying for the IAAP cert in web a11y.</p>
