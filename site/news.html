                <h3>EU Web Accessibility Directive</h3>
                <p>
                    Directive (EU) 2016/2102 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 October 2016 on the accessibility of the websites and mobile applications of public sector bodies requires public bodies to ensure their websites and apps are accessible to persons with disabilities. All websites created after 23 September 2018 will have to be accessible by 23 September 2019. Existing websites will have to comply by 23 September 2020. All mobile applications will have to be accessible by 23 June 2021. The Directive will be transposed into Irish law via Regulations that are currently being drafted by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment. Accessibility is defined within the Directive as meaning web content and mobile apps must be 'Perceivable, Operable and Usable' by persons with disabilities, and they must be 'Robust' enough to work on different browsers, and with different assistive technologies. The Directive requires Member States to monitor and report on the accessibility of the websites and mobile apps of most public bodies. Reviews are conducted against a harmonised European standard, EN 301 549, which replicates the more commonly known Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.

                    <h3> The Business case for Digital Accessibility</h3>
                    <img class="business" src="business.jpg" alt="business">
                    <p class="maintext">What are the benefits of making your website accessibile?:
                        <ul>
                            <li><em>Drive Innovation:</em> Accessibility features in products and services often solve unanticipated problems.</li>
                            <li> <em>Enhance Your Brand:</em> Diversity and inclusion efforts so important to business success are accelerated with a clear, well-integrated accessibility commitment. </li>
                            <li><em>Extend Market Reach</em>: The global market of people with disabilities is over 1 billion people with a spending power of more than $6 trillion. Accessibility often improves the online experience for all users.</li>
                            <li><em> Legal Risk:</em> Many countries have laws requiring digital accessibility, and the issue is of increased legal concern.</li>
                        </ul>
